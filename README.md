BridgeIt

OVERVIEW
Crowdfunding websites such as Groupon, AngelList, Crowdfunder, etc. are websites that focus on and connect businesses to local investors who are looking for equity investments and future collaborations. BridgeIt is not just a crowdfunding website, but it also helps small businesses or start-ups who are struggling with almost every kind of services that they might need such as funding, advising (legal, marketing, business strategies, cost allocation), financial analyzing (costs and revenues), connect to suppliers of raw materials and skilled workers who are looking for part-time jobs, and connect to office space or warehouse providers. All these preparatory activities take a lot of time to get done physically and one-on-one. But our website brings all of these services together to create a comprehensive platform so that young entrepreneurs can complete all of these tasks on the same platform within limited time and with minimum costs.
